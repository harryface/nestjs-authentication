## Description
* NestJS Authentication Boilerplate
This repository contains a NestJS application with various authentication strategies implemented:
- Local authentication using email/username and password
- Google authentication using OAuth
- Facebook authentication using OAuth
The application is built using NestJS and features multiple branches with different ORM solutions:
- Prisma (branch: master)
- TypeORM (branch: auth_orm_typeorm)
- Sequelize (branch: auth_orm_sequelize)
This boilerplate provides a starting point for building robust and scalable authentication systems with NestJS. You can explore different ORM solutions by switching between branches.

Note: You may need to configure environment variables and OAuth credentials to use the authentication strategies.
